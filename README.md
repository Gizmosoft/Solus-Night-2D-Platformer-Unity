# Solus-Night-2D-Platformer-Unity
 A small 2D adventure platformer game created in Unity

This repository has the source code for the Solus Night Project. All the Scripts are written in C# and were linked to Unity Game Objects.

This is my first 2D game made with Unity Engine and I've included almost every aspect of what I have learnt till now.

The idea of Solus Night revolves around our main character stuck in a dark, spooky neighborhood. Somehow, the whole town looks dark. But there are still few lights out there which could probably show you the path. Use the arrow keys on your computer to navigate left and right. Press the Up arrow to Jump. There are few crystals on the way to help you find your way to the source of all the problems going on in the town. Find your way out of this dark world to turn everything back to normal once again. 

The game can be found here:

Have fun playing this very-short 2D adventure platformer.
